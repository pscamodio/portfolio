My portfolio website.

It contains:
* A showcase of the project I worked on
* A basic "blog" for capturing notes about my work expiriences
* A way to contact me

# Development
The website is built with NextJS, and used as a way to learn how to use this framework.

The dev environment is managed trough gitpod. To start a workspace on this project please open

# Deployment
I still need to configure the website deployment
